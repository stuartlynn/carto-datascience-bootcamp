# US County Income 1969-2017

This documents the creation of the data set `uscountypcincome.gpkg` that contains US per capita income at the county level.

## Data Sources

The original files have been archived at [gdsbook/data\_archive/us\_county_income](https://github.com/gdsbook/data_archive) and include:

- `CANINC1.zip`, which includes attribute data for per capita income for US counties 1969-2017
- `tl_2019_us_county.zip`, with the geometries for each county

The data archive has urls back to the original sources for the downloads.

## Notebooks

To reproduce the dataset, you can run the [`us_county_income_clean.ipynb` notebook](us_county_income_clean). The result is the analysis-ready `uscountypcincome.gpkg` file with US county per capita incomes 1969-2017 and county geometries.
