This, then, unites the two concepts of open science and geographical thinking. \n",

    "## Fundamentals of geographic data structures\n",
    "\n",
    "As outlined in Chapter 1, there are a few main data structures that are used in geographic data science: geographic tables (which are generally matched to an object data model), rasters or surfaces (which are generally matched to a field data model), and spatial networks (which are generally matched to a graph data model). We discuss these in turn throughout this section. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Geographic tables\n",
    "\n",
    "Geographic objects are usually matched to what we called the *geographic table*. Geographic tables can be thought of as a tab in a spreadsheet where one of the columns records geometric information. This data structure represents a single geographic object as a row of a table; each column in the table records information about the object, its attributes or features, as we will see below. Typically, there is a special column in this table that records the *geometry* of the object. Computer systems that use this data structure are intended to add geography into a *relational database*, such as PostgreSQL (through its PostGIS extension) or sqlite (through its spatialite extension). Beyond this, however, many data science languages (such as R, Julia, and Python), have packages that adopt this data structure as well (such as `sf`, `GeoTables.jl`, and `geopandas`), and it is rapidly becoming the main data structure for object-based geographic data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Before proceeding, though, it helps to mention a quick clarification on\n",
    "terminology. Throughout this book, regardless of the data structure used, we\n",
    "will refer to a measurement about an observation as a *feature*. This is\n",
    "consistent with other work in data science and machine learning. Then, one set\n",
    "of measurements is a *sample*. For tables, this means a feature is a column, and\n",
    "a sample is a row. Historically, though, geographic information scientists have\n",
    "used the word \"feature\" to mean an individual observation, since a \"feature\" in\n",
    "cartography is an entity on a map, and \"attribute\" to describe characteristics\n",
    "of that observation. Elsewhere, a feature may be called a \"variable,\" and a\n",
    "sample is referred to as a \"record.\" So, consistent terminology is important: for this book, a *feature* is one measured trait pertaining to an observation (column), and a *sample* is one set of measurements (row). \n",
    "\n",
    "To understand the structure of geographic tables, it will help to read in the `countries_clean.gpkg` dataset included in this book that describes countries in the world. To read in this data, we can use the `read_file()` method in `geopandas`:[^package-v-function]"

    "\n",
    "Spatial graphs store connections between objects through space. These\n",
    "connections may derive from geographical topology (e.g., contiguity), distance,\n",
    "or more sophisticated dimensions such as interaction flows (e.g., commuting,\n",
    "trade, communication). Compared to geographic tables and surfaces, spatial\n",
    "graphs are rather different. First, in most cases they do not record\n",
    "measurements about given phenomena, but instead focus on *connections*, on\n",
    "storing relationships between objects as they are facilitated (or impeded in\n",
    "their absence) by space. Second, because of this relational nature, the data are\n",
    "organized in a more unstructured fashion: while one sample may be connected to\n",
    "only one other sample, another one can display several links. This is in stark contrast to geographic tables and surfaces, both of which have a clearly defined structure, shape and dimensionality in which data are organized. \n",
    "\n",
    "These particularities translate into a different set of Python data structures. Unlike the previous data structures we have seen, there are quite a few data structures to represent spatial graphs, each optimized for different contexts. One such case is the use of spatial connections in statistical methods such as exploratory data analysis or regression. For this, the most common data structure are spatial weights matrices, to which we devote the next chapter. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, we briefly review a different way of representing spatial graphs that is much closer to the mathematical concept of a graph. A graph is composed of *nodes* that are linked together by *edges*. In a spatial network, *nodes* may represent geographical places, and thus have a specific location; likewise, *edges* may represent geographical paths between these places. Networks require both *nodes* and *edges* to analyze their structure. \n",

These represent the conventional pairings that align data models to data structures with Python representations. However, while the conventional pairings are well-used, there are others in active use and many more to yet be developed. Interestingly, many new pairings are driven by new developments in technology, enabling approaches that were not possible in the past or creating situations (e.g., large datasets) that make the conventional approach limiting. Therefore, in this second section of the chapter, we step a bit \"out of the box\" to explore cases in which it may make sense to represent a dataset with a data structure that might not be the most obvious initial choice. \n"

    "### Surfaces as tables\n",
    "\n",
    "The first case we explore is treating surfaces as (geo-)tables. In this context, we shift from an approach where each dimension has a clear mapping to a spatial or temporal aspect of the dataset, to one where each sample, cell of the surface/cube is represented as a row in a table. This approach runs contrary to the general consensus that fields are best represented as surfaces or rasters because that allows us to index space and time \"by default\" based on the location of values within the data structure. Shifting to a tabular structure implies either losing that space-time reference, or having to build it manually with auxiliary objects (e.g., a spatial graph). In almost any case, operating on this format is less efficient than it *could* be if we had bespoke algorithms built around surface structures. Finally, from a more conceptual point of view, treating pixels as independent realizations of a process that we *know* is continuous can be computationally inefficient and statistically flawed. \n",
    "\n",
    "This perspective, however, also involves important benefits. First, sometimes we *don't* need location for our particular application. Maybe we are interested in calculating overall descriptive statistics; or maybe we need to run an analysis that is entirely atomic in the sense that it operates on each sample in isolation from all the other ones.  Second, by \"going tabular\" we recast our specialized, spatial data into the most common data structure available, for which a large amount of commodity technology is built. This means many new tools can be used for analysis. So-called \"big data\" technologies, such as distributed systems, are much more common, robust, and tested for tabular data than for spatial surfaces. *If* we can translate our spatial challenge into a tabular challenge, we can immediately plug in technology that is more optimized and, in some cases, reliable. Further, some analytic toolboxes common in (geographic) data science are entirely built around tabular structures. Machine learning packages such as `scikit-learn`, or some spatial analytics (such as most methods in the Pysal family of packages) are designed around this data structure. Converting our surfaces into tables thus allows us to plug into a much wider suite of (potentially) efficient tools and techniques.\n",

    "The case for converting tables into surfaces is perhaps less controversial than that for turning surfaces into tables. This is an approach we can take in cases where we are interested in the *overall* distribution of objects (usually points) and we have so many that it is not only technically more efficient to represent them as a surface, but conceptually it is also easier to think about the points as uneven measurements from a continuous field. To illustrate this approach, we will use the dataset of [Tokyo photographs](../data/tokyo/tokyo_cleaning) we loaded above into `gt_points`.\n",

    "In this figure, it is hard to tell anything about the density of points in the center of the image due to *overplotting*: while points *theoretically* have no width, they *must* have some dimension in order for us to see them! Therefore, point *markers* often plot on top of one another, obscuring the true pattern and density in dense areas. Converting the dataset from a geo-table into a surface involves laying out a grid and counting how many points fall within each cell. In one sense, this is the reverse operation to what we saw when computing zonal statistics in the previous section: instead of aggregating cells into objects, we aggregate objects into cells. Both operations, however, involve aggregation that reduces the amount of information present in order to make the (new) data more manageable. \n",

    "### Networks as graphs *and* tables\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous chapter, we saw networks as data structures that store *connections* between objects. We also discussed how this broad definition includes many interpretations that focus on different aspects of the networks. While spatial analytics may use graphs to record the topology of a table of objects such as polygons, transport applications may treat the network representation of the street layout as a set of objects itself, in this case lines. In this final section we show how one can flip back and forth between one representation and another, to take advantage of different aspects.\n",
    "\n",
    "We start with the `graph` object from the [previous section](#Spatial-graphs). Remember this captures the street layout around Yoyogi park in Tokyo. We have seen how, stored under this data structure, it is easy to query which node is connected to which, and which ones are at the end of a given edge. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, in some cases, we may want to convert the graph into a structure that allows us to operate on each component of the network independently. For example, we may want to map streets, calculate segment lengths, or draw buffers around each intersection. These are all operations that do not require topological information, that are standard for geo-tables, and that are irrelevant to the graph structure. In this context, it makes sense to convert our `graph` to two geo-tables, one for intersections (graph nodes) and one for street segments (graph edges). In `osmnx`, we can do that with the built-in converter:"

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, this chapter provides an overview of the mappings between data models, presented in Chapter 2, and data structures that are common in Python. Beyond the data structures discussed here, the Python ecosystem is vast, deep, and ever-changing. Part of this is the ease with which you can create your own representations to express different aspects of a problem at hand. However, by focusing on our shared representations and the interfaces between these representations, you can generally conduct any analysis you need. By creating unique, bespoke representations, your analysis might be more efficient, but you can also inadvertently isolate it from other developers and render useful tools inoperable. Therefore, a solid understanding of the basic data structures (the `GeoDataFrame`, `DataArray`, and `Graph`) will be sufficient to support nearly any analysis you need to conduct. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. One way to convert from `Multi-`type geometries into many individual geometries is using the `explode()` method of a GeoDataFrame. Using the `explode()` method, can you find out how many islands are in Indonesia?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Using `osmnx`, are you able to extract the street graph for your hometown?\n",
    "\n",
    "3. As you have seen with the `osmnx.graph_to_gdfs()` method, it is possible to convert a graph into the constituent nodes and edges. Graphs have many other kinds of non-geographical representations. Many of these are provided in `networkx` methods that start with `to_`. How many representations of graphs are currently supported?\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Using `networkx.to_edgelist()`, what \"extra\" information does `osmnx` include when building the dataframe for edges?\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Instead of computing the average elevation for each neighborhood in San Diego, can you answer the following queries?\n",
    "  - What neighborhood (or neighborhoods) have the *the highest average elevation*?\n",
    "  - What neighborhood (or neighborhoods) have *the highest point single point*?\n",
    "  - Can you find the neighborhood (or neighborhoods) with *the largest elevation change*?\n",
    "\n",
    "[^package-v-function]: We will generally use two curved brackets (such as `method_name()`) to denote a *function*, and will omit them (such as `package`) when referring to an object or package.]\n",
    "[^xarray-query]: Although, if all you want to do is this type of query, `xarray` is well equipped for this kind of task too."
